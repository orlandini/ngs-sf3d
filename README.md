# ngs-sf3d

Experiments with electromagnetics in 3D using [NGSolve](htpps://ngsolve.org) FEM library.

This project aims to simulate the propagation of eigenmodes of optical waveguides,
obtained through modal analysis, in three dimensions, with special interest in
analysing the efficiency of combinations of preconditioners and iterative solvers
for the linear system of the 3D model.
